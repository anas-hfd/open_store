Open Store : 

Open Store is a full-stack web application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js).
The goal of this project is to gain hands-on experience in full-stack development, while practicing best practices for building scalable and robust applications.

Features : 
Light and Dark Mode: Toggle between light and dark themes for an enhanced user experience.

Product Management:
Add new products to the store.
Edit products with immediate updates (no page refresh required).
Delete products instantly.

Core Technologies Used: 
1. MongoDB :
A flexible, document-based NoSQL database used to store product data.
Gained experience in data modeling and managing collections in MongoDB.

2. Express.js
A minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework.
Used to build and manage the backend API and route handling.

3. React
Frontend JavaScript library for building interactive user interfaces.
Utilized for building the product management interface with live updates.

4. Node.js
Server-side JavaScript runtime environment.
Used to handle server-side logic and API requests.

Learning Experience:
Server Setup:
Learned how to set up a Node.js server with Express.js for handling backend logic.

MongoDB Integration:
Integrated MongoDB into the application to store and manage product data.

SQL vs NoSQL:
Gained insight into the differences between SQL and NoSQL databases, and the advantages of NoSQL in document-based data management.

Creating a Product Model:
Modeled the product schema using MongoDB, defining key fields such as name, price, and image URL.

Building the API:
Developed a RESTful API to handle CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for products.

Frontend Development:
Built a dynamic and responsive user interface with React.
Implemented features such as live product editing without page refresh and instant product deletion.

Deployment:
Deployed the application using Render, learning the process of deployment for full-stack applications.

Conclusion
Open Store is a practical project to build a full-stack application using modern web development tools. It combines a robust backend with a dynamic, interactive frontend, offering valuable experience in both server and client-side development.
